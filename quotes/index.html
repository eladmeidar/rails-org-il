    &#8220;Rails is the most well thought-out web development framework I’ve ever used.
    And that’s in a decade of doing web applications for a living. I’ve built my
    own frameworks, helped develop the Servlet API, and have created more than
    a few web servers from scratch. Nobody has done it like this before.&#8221;<br />

    &#8220;Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to programming.
    Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or months
    to develop can be produced in a matter of days.&#8221;<br />

    &#8220;It is impossible not to notice Ruby on Rails.  It has had a huge effect both in
    and outside the Ruby community... Rails has become a standard to which even
    well-established tools are comparing themselves to.&#8221;<br />
    <cite>-Martin Fowler, Author of Refactoring, PoEAA, XP Explained</cite>
  </p>

  <p class="quote" id="quote4">
    &#8220;What sets this framework apart from all of the others is the preference for
    convention over configuration making applications easier
    to develop and understand.&#8221;<br />
    <cite>-Sam Ruby, ASF board of directors</cite>
  </p>

  <p class="quote" id="quote5">
    &#8220;Before Ruby on Rails, web programming required a lot of verbiage, steps and time.
    Now, web designers and software engineers can develop a website
    much faster and more simply, enabling them to be more productive
    and effective in their work.&#8221;<br />

  <p class="quote" id="quote6">
    &#8220;After researching the market, Ruby on Rails stood out as the best choice.
    We have been very happy with that decision.  We will continue
    building on Rails and consider it a key business advantage.&#8221;<br />

  <p class="quote" id="quote7">
    &#8220;Ruby on Rails is astounding. Using it is like watching a kung-fu movie,
    where a dozen bad-ass frameworks prepare to beat up the little newcomer
    only to be handed their asses in a variety of imaginative ways.&#8221;<br />
