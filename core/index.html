    <b>David Heinemeier Hansson (dhh)</b> extracted Ruby on Rails from his work on <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>. 
    He released the framework as open source in July of 2004,
    but didn't share the commit rights until February of 2005. Among the core team, he's infamous for his ruthless delegation, which is
    often executed as a request to "Please Do Investigate". He's a partner at <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a> and
    an <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">opinionated blogger</a>.
